PrecheltGatsChallenge
=====================

Java solution to Prehcalt-Gat's Challenge http://www.flownet.com/ron/papers/lisp-java/instructions.html

This is an attempt to code solution is Java for the programming challenge presented in the above location.

Gat conducted the experiment to see if Lisp was better than Java. Although the result of his experiement says so,
I would prefer to believe what I have experienced in the process of completing above challenge.

My conclusion:
* Algorithm used matters most!
* Some special programming constructs provided by programming languages are advantages but not absolute necessary.
* There is not much of a gain in terms of implementation time - atleast for this program, I could complete it 
well within best time for LISP. In terms of lines of code - may be java is bloated, on the positive side it is very much readable!
